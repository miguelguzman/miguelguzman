- 👋 Hi, I’m @miguelguzman
- 👀 I’m interested in barcodes, labeling, web technologies, AI, and software development in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GitHub, web technologies, etc. I've been a desktop software developer on and off for many years.
-     I've got experience in Windows Forms, Oracle, SQL, and old school web. I've been locked in the four walls of the
-     company that I work for, but now I'm determined to get up to speed on what's new out there.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on barcode projects, enterprise labeling systems, and AI.
- 📫 How to reach me: guelo@outlook.com
